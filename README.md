# MERN Stack App with JWT Authentication

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for user login/signup functionality and handles multiple users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

5. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your database credentials:
   ```plaintext
   DB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

## Usage

1. To start the server, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start both the server and the client concurrently.

2. Alternatively, you can start the server and client separately:
   - To run the server only:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - To run the client only:
     ```bash
     npm run client
     ```

## Development

- The server code resides in the root directory.
- The client code resides in the `client` directory.
- Server routes are defined in the `routes` directory.
- User authentication logic is implemented in the `controllers/authController.js`.
- React components are located in the `client/src/components` directory.
